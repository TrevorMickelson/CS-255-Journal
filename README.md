### Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPass system is meant to be an online solution for students to more easily take drivers tests. The system neede to allow for scheduling appointments, and handling online drivers testing.

### What did you do particularly well?
I believe I handled the security systems well, as I made sure there would be 2FA and decent encryption.

### If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I think the front end of the software wasn't documented well, and could definitely be revised. IO'd revise it by documenting the paginations, and how it would be easy to use for the user.

### How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
The main thing I considered was how a user was going to be able to purchase packages, and schedule their appointments, as I figure this was the most important aspect. It's important to consider the users needs as the users are the ones that actually use the software.

### How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I believe agile is the best approach to software, as requirements are rarely static and they change often. I believe software systems should be built with change in mind, as hard coding it for one thing would make changes impossible.
